			 <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/abrahamlincolnh09nico/page/218/mode/2up">Flashback Friday to August 1864</a>, two months <em>after</em> Abraham Lincoln was renominated by the Republican national convention for reelection, and barely two months <em>before</em> the election:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The party anxiety of certain Republican leaders had at this juncture become unusually sensitive. The Democratic National Convention was about to meet in the city of Chicago, and the nomination of McClellan as its candidate was strongly foreshadowed. In anticipation, Democratic leaders, newspapers, and delegates were specially active and boastful. Their unwonted confidence and bold prophecies created general uneasiness among Republicans, and, in a few instances, produced a downright panic. Under this feeling the National Executive Committee of the Republican party met in New York for consultation, and on the 22d of August, its chairman, Henry J. Raymond, wrote the President <a href="https://archive.org/details/abrahamlincolnh09nico/page/218/mode/2up">the following extraordinary letter</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip; prompting Lincoln to write <a href="https://www.friendsofthelincolncollection.org/lincoln-lore/lincolns-strangest-document-the-blind-memorandum-of-august-23-1864-by-allen-c-guelzo/">this extraordinary memo</a>.</p>

			 <p>While doing unrelated research in the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau records for Texas, I came across this printed antebellum advertisement for the <a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/houston-academy">Houston Academy</a>. Today, a <a href="https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=125722">plaque</a> at the Kinder High School for Performing and Visual Arts (HSPVA) marks the school&rsquo;s site, but records about the academy are scarce, so every scrap about its history seems valuable.</p>
<p>Of course, having recently worked on a <a href="https://taskforce.rice.edu">task force about Rice University&rsquo;s history</a>, I immediately noticed William Marsh Rice&rsquo;s name as a trustee. His role as an incorporator of this version of the academy has long been known, but I don&rsquo;t recall seeing B. A. Shepherd, namesake of Rice&rsquo;s Shepherd School, identified as president of the board.</p>
<p>The undated antebellum advertisement was included with an 1867 letter to the bureau by Professor E. Pettit as evidence of his connections in Houston; by then, Pettit (who said he had always been a Unionist) was residing in Anderson County and inquiring about starting a manual labor school for formerly enslaved people in the region.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://coloredconventions.org/">The Colored Conventions Project</a> (CCP) is an amazing research collective that documents Black political organizing across the nineteenth century. It‚Äôs also partially crowdsourced, and tonight I may have found a document to contribute.</p>
<p><a href="https://omeka.coloredconventions.org/convention-by-year">Scroll down the project‚Äôs list of state, regional, and national conventions organized by African Americans before, during, and long after the Civil War</a>. You‚Äôll quickly see why the CCP is so important. Historians know that Black activists worked for civil rights long before ‚ÄúThe Civil Rights Movement‚Äù of the 1960s. CCP has the receipts to prove it.</p>
<p>But that list also shows there are still some meetings that the project is ‚Äúseeking records‚Äù for. In other words, they know from other sources when and where a Black convention occurred, but they don‚Äôt yet have the minutes. One such gap they‚Äôve identified is the ‚Äú1871 Texas State Colored Convention held in Houston.‚Äù <a href="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth203071/m1/1/zoom/?q=keppard&amp;resolution=1.5&amp;lat=5272.9279639983015&amp;lon=1060.090236445334">The minutes for that meeting appear to be here</a>.</p>
<p>The link above points to an August 26, 1871, article on the front page of <em>The Representative,</em> an African American newspaper in Galveston published by <a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/nelson-richard">Richard Nelson</a>, reportedly the first Black Texan to own, edit, and publish his own newspaper. Under the headline ‚ÄúTexas State Convention,‚Äù Nelson reprinted a series of resolutions and votes taken at a meeting held on August 3 in Houston. The meeting was called for the purpose of choosing delegates from Texas to another ‚Äúcolored convention‚Äù that the CCP does have records for: <a href="https://omeka.coloredconventions.org/items/show/543">The Southern States Convention of Colored Men held at Columbia, SC, in October 1871</a>. And those records show that the delegates elected at the August 3 meeting are the same ones who showed up in Columbia in October.</p>
<p>The Black Texans who gathered in Houston on August 3 likely chose that date for their meeting because a state Republican Party convention was happening in Houston the same week. Men like Nelson and <a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/allen-richard">Richard Allen</a> took an active part in both. The <em>Houston Daily Union,</em> a radical Republican sheet, included the same minutes printed by Nelson in its August 4 issue under the headline ‚ÄúThe Labor Convention.‚Äù The day before, the <em>Union</em> reported that the meetings that week had also brought the ‚ÄúGalveston Brass Band,‚Äù reputed to be ‚Äúthe oldest colored band in the State,‚Äù to town. And on August 5, the <em>Union</em> listed again the delegates who had been elected earlier that week to represent Texas in the ‚ÄúSouthern States Convention‚Äù in South Carolina: Richard Allen, Richard Nelson, James Green, J. H. Townsend, <a href="https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/debruhl-john">John DeBruhl</a>, and D. G. Scott.</p>
<p>Looking forward to submitting these to the CCP to see what the project team thinks. In the meantime, <a href="https://coloredconventions.org/about-conventions/submit-records/">keep an eye out for the other meetings that still need records</a> and help advance the project if you can!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>In an earlier note about <a href="https://updates.wcaleb.org/2024/06/20/juneteenth-and-baseball.html">Juneteenth and baseball</a>, I found myself wondering what an 1871 article in Houston meant by referring to a &ldquo;tournament&rdquo; that would take place on the State Fair grounds as part of the two-day celebrations of June 19.</p>
<p>Well, in 1938, <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951001963803p&amp;seq=79">local historian Jesse Ziegler</a> suggested that some of the old (white) residents of Houston had &ldquo;introduced tournaments at the old fair grounds in the &lsquo;Seventies.'&rdquo; Ziegler continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ladies on side saddles, with long plush skirts, flowing plumes on wide hats and buff gauntlets would accompany their knights wearing colors, when they performed with their lances and rings on the frames.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the Fair Grounds location of the 1871 Juneteenth celebration I was interested in, I&rsquo;m now wondering if an event of a similar sort took place there. Ziegler, a white historian identified with the Sons of the Confederate Veterans, would not be the best source for discovering that, but the clue is interesting nonetheless.</p>
<p>[P.S. at 12:53: And the more I think about it, this would be an odd and potentially subversive activity, given the role that faux-medieval &ldquo;ring tournaments&rdquo; played in white Lost Cause rituals elsewhere in the South, especially in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War. Paul Christopher Anderson writes about those in an essay collection titled, appropriately, <a href="https://ugapress.org/book/9780820341279/weirding-the-war/">Weirding the War</a>.]</p>

			 <p>Historian Lou Moore wrote an interesting post a few years ago about <a href="https://firstandpen.com/juneteenth-celebrates-freedom-and-the-power-of-black-baseball/">Juneteenth and the rise of Black baseball</a>, citing a game that took place at a celebration in Bastrop, TX, 1883.</p>
<p>Baseball games were played at some of the earliest Juneteenth celebrations in Houston, too, including at <a href="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth232588/m1/1/zoom/?resolution=2&amp;lat=1602.3364074297115&amp;lon=2720.5324940680002">the Freeman&rsquo;s Demonstration in 1870</a>. The next year, for the fifth anniversary of the observance of Juneteenth, local organizers held a two-day Emancipation Celebration at the Fair Grounds. According to an announcement in the Houston <em>Union,</em> from June 17, 1871, the second day would feature &ldquo;a match game of Base Ball between the Galveston and Houston Base Ball Clubs for a prize at 10 o&rsquo;clock A.M., and a Tournament to commence at half-past one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both articles reference a game and a tournament, making me wonder how the latter was organized and if it also referred to baseball or something else. Either way, it&rsquo;s fitting that <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/mlb-at-rickwood-field-game-will-celebrate-willie-mays">Major League Baseball has been honoring the Negro Leagues this week with games at Rickwood Field</a>. The association of Juneteenth with baseball goes <em>way</em> back, to the very beginning in the very places where the holiday began.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This morning I attended an excellent panel, <a href="https://events.rice.edu/event/360499-juneteenth-and-justice-for-all-black-struggle-the">Juneteenth and Justice for All: Black Struggle, the Constitution, and Democratic Futures</a>, on campus at Rice. From it I learned (among many things) that <a href="https://www.pennpress.org/9781512825800/she-changed-the-nation/">Mary Ellen Curtin&rsquo;s forthcoming biography</a> of native Houstonian <a href="https://kinder.rice.edu/urbanedge/houston-honors-barbara-jordan">Barbara Jordan</a> is now available for preorder.</p>
<p>As we listened to a recorded snippet from <a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/impeachment/my-faith-constitution-whole-it-complete-it-total">Representative Jordan&rsquo;s famous 1974 impeachment speech</a>, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about the circumstances surrounding what was likely her first time speaking on the Rice campus. In 1963, while the university was still segregated and just beginning a lawsuit to revise its founding charter, Jordan was invited by the Young Democrats to speak at one of the university&rsquo;s residential colleges. <a href="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth244899/m1/5/?q=%22barbara%20jordan%22">But her appearance was reported in the student newspaper only after it had occurred.</a></p>
<p>Many years later, in an untitled 1989 speech now available only in <a href="https://archives.library.rice.edu/repositories/2/resources/1347/collection_organization#tree::archival_object_333180">his archival papers</a>, English professor Alan Grob claimed that &ldquo;the first black speaker at Rice&rdquo; was &ldquo;a very young woman who had recently graduated from Texas Southern and Boston University Law School, Barbara Jordan, who was apparently surreptitiously brought to Jones College to speak in behalf of desegregation (which she did extremely well) and the right of people like herself to be considered for admission to Rice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grob was wrong about Jordan&rsquo;s being the first Black speaker on campus. He was not wrong&mdash;I am sure of this&mdash;to remember her speech as a powerful one. And it was not her last appearance at Rice. When she returned to campus two years later, <a href="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth244952/m1/1/">Jordan&rsquo;s photograph was featured on the student newspaper&rsquo;s front page</a>, opposite a report on Rice&rsquo;s ongoing litigation about changing its charter. Her subject: redistricting in Texas to provide more equitable representation to cities and end rural domination in the state. &ldquo;For the first time in Texas,&rdquo; she said on that occasion, &ldquo;we are going to have legislators who represent people, not cattle.&rdquo; It was the kind of richly layered comment that typified Jordan&rsquo;s speeches. I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading Curtin&rsquo;s new biography.</p>

Nine years ago, a few years after starting the notebook, I wrote a <a href="https://gist.github.com/wcaleb/60d52759f6d0c5bc270d">Python script</a> that would check for changes to the wiki&rsquo;s git repo and post updates to Twitter, like <a href="http://wcaleb.org/twitter/619614774326759426/">this</a> or <a href="http://wcaleb.org/twitter/619614774326759426/">this</a>. Now I&rsquo;ve replaced that with a <a href="https://gist.github.com/wcaleb/67d7554ce2be625a090f8a72a6cd92d6">bash script</a> that posts updates to this site using <code>curl</code> and <a href="https://book.micro.blog/micropub/">Micropub</a>, like <a href="https://updates.wcaleb.org/2024/06/12/updated-some-notes.html">this</a> or <a href="https://updates.wcaleb.org/2024/06/08/updated-some-notes.html">this</a>.

			 <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000902170648/http://www.tamu.edu/chr/agora/">This might be the earliest (extant) website I ever made.</a> It was for a now long-defunct online undergraduate humanities journal that I started while in college, around the time I was just learning about how to write HTML.</p>
<p><em>Agora</em> didn&rsquo;t last long, but it has the distinction (I think) of being the first to publish the scholarly work of my fellow Texan historian and digital humanist <a href="https://www.andrewtorget.com">Andrew Torget</a>. Only after we were out of graduate school, many years later, did Andrew and I put together that our paths had crossed as undergrads in the hypertext pages of <em>Agora,</em> where I helped to edit <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040615140143/http://www.tamu.edu/chr/agora/winter00/torget.pdf">his article on the work of the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau in Texas</a> for the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011115093434/http://www.tamu.edu/chr/agora/archives.html">Winter 2000 issue</a>, both of which are still preserved in the Internet Archive. Amazingly, despite being history majors on campus at the same time, we never had a class together or met in person as undergraduates.</p>
<p>Many years after we realized and remembered <em>that</em> connection, Andrew invited me to speak about <a href="http://wcaleb.org/books/sweet-taste-of-liberty"><em>Sweet Taste of Liberty</em></a> at UNT. And it was then that we realized a further small-world connection: <a href="http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Robertson%20County">Robertson County</a>, the focus of his long-ago paper, was also the county where Henrietta Wood and other enslaved people were forced to work by Mississippi planter Gerard Brandon during and immediately after the Civil War. In following Wood&rsquo;s story to Texas, I had ended up looking, unawares, at some of the same agents and Bureau sources Andrew had mined decades before, though on FamilySearch instead of on the microfilm reels I think he probably used.</p>
<p>I guess the <a href="http://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> is aptly named, because finding that <em>Agora</em> snapshot takes me <em>way</em> back.</p>

			 <p>After a day at Houston‚Äôs Municipal Court for jury service (without being selected), I picked up this gem of a rare book at nearby <a href="https://kaboombooks.com/">Kaboom Books</a>.</p>
<p>Published in 1942, it‚Äôs the <a href="https://archive.org/details/houstonahistory00writmiss/mode/1up">Houston installment</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Guide_Series">American Guide Series</a> of books produced by the Federal Writers‚Äô Project during the New Deal. The subtitle (which is different from the one on the title page) is a bit overconfident, I‚Äôd say, but it‚Äôs still a valuable resource.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs rare to see a copy with the dust jacket, which may be intended to portray the Battle of San Jacinto; a map of the battlefield is on the inside cover. Even rarer, though, to find inside a bookmark from Colleen‚Äôs Books, a former Houston rare books store that I never knew about until today. <a href="http://southbelthouston.blogspot.com/2017/11/colleens-books-6880-telephone-rd-houston.html?m=1">There‚Äôs a nice remembrance of the place online.</a>.</p>

			 <p>Like so many others over this last week, I am mourning the loss of a beloved teacher and mentor: American intellectual historian <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/05/29/dorothy-ross-obituary/">Dorothy Ross</a>. Together with Ronald G. Walters, Dorothy was one of my doctoral co-advisors at Johns Hopkins University and had a profound impact on my life and career.</p>
<p>Dorothy challenged her students. In the first week of my first semester of her seminar, we were assigned to read all of Perry Miller&rsquo;s <em>New England Mind,</em> a book of some 500 pages, and summarize it in a pr√©cis of four pages or less. The next assignment was to do the same with <em>The Machiavellian Moment</em> by John Pocock!</p>
<p>Yet within and behind such challenges was a deeper message. From Day One, Dorothy treated her students as colleagues and respected peers, a status we certainly had not earned but that she believed, against the evidence, that we could grow into. There was, as Miller might have put it, a covenant established between teacher and student, one defined always by Dorothy&rsquo;s incomparable intellect and grace.</p>
<p>I last saw her in person a few years ago when this picture was taken at a breakfast we shared in Washington, D.C. I will miss her warmth and wise counsel very much.</p>

			 <p>A number of pages on the Internet, including on sites hosted by the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war">National Archives</a> and the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/chyo/learn/historyculture/african-americans-in-the-civil-war.htm">National Park Service</a>, attribute these words to the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letter, U.S., let him get an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoulder and bullets in his pocket, there is no power on earth that can deny that he has earned the right to citizenship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That bugged me, first, because the quotation contains a grammatical error. &ldquo;U&rdquo; and &ldquo;S&rdquo; are <em>letters</em> plural, not &ldquo;letter&rdquo; singular. There also seems to be an &ldquo;and&rdquo; missing after the final comma.</p>
<p>Were those errors really Douglass&rsquo;s, I wondered? I tracked down the source of the quotation in the scholarly, multivolume work, <em>The Frederick Douglass Papers,</em> edited by John W. Blassingame and published by Yale University Press. Series One, Volume 3, page 596, contains the full quote this way, from a speech delivered in Philadelphia on July 6, 1863:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letters U.S.; let him get an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoulder, and bullets in his pocket, and there is no power on the earth or under the earth which can deny that he has earned the right of citizenship in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems to settle that Douglass did say &ldquo;letters&rdquo; and &ldquo;and.&rdquo; And it also reveals another phrase which even many sources that get most of the quote right, like the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/civil-war-and-reconstruction-1861-1877/african-american-soldiers-during-the-civil-war/">Library of Congress</a>, sometimes leave out: his reference to there being no power &ldquo;under the earth&rdquo; capable of denying a Black soldier&rsquo;s citizenship.</p>
<p>One can almost imagine Douglass, one of history&rsquo;s great orators, pausing and looking down towards hell as he uttered that sardonic phrase. If he did, the rhetorical flourish would better explain why, according to the transcript in the <em>Frederick Douglass Papers,</em> the sentence was followed not only by applause from the audience, but by laughter.</p>

			 <p>As a historian and a dad, I often gently compel family members to traipse around the country looking for or at the historic sites I study. (Sorry, not sorry, kids!) On a recent trip through Waco, I wanted to visit the historic site of A. J. Moore High School, but that proved more difficult than I expected.</p>
<p>With roots stretching back to Reconstruction, <a href="https://wacohistory.org/items/show/22">A. J. Moore High School</a> was a storied and vital institution for Waco‚Äôs African American community until its closure in 1971. An active <a href="https://ajmoorealumni.org/about/">alumni community</a> keeps its legacy alive.</p>
<p>I was interested in visiting the school site because the <a href="https://taskforce.rice.edu/final-report">final report</a> of Rice University‚Äôs Task Force on Slavery, Segregation, and Racial Injustice, which I co-chaired, opens with a scene from the school‚Äôs 1967 commencement ceremony. That year‚Äôs Moore valedictorian, Gloria Darlene Oliver, became perhaps the fifth Black undergraduate student ever to enroll at Rice, which had just begun to desegregate a few years before.</p>
<p>I knew there was a historical marker for Moore High, but the excellent article at <a href="https://wacohistory.org/items/show/22">Waco History</a> gave the school‚Äôs address on First Street, which no longer shows up on maps. Other pages I found, like <a href="https://texashistoricalmarkers.weebly.com/a-j-moore-high-school.html">this one</a>, apparently confuse the marker‚Äôs location with the location of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.J._Moore_Academy">A. J. Moore Academy</a> (also now closed). Recent articles about Moore history from Waco‚Äôs local newspaper were behind a paywall, which is no help when the family is waiting semi-patiently on Dad to track down a marker.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the location for the marker given by the <a href="https://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/Details/5309000053">Texas Historical Commission</a> is the correct one, and eventually I landed there. This may be a case where my preference for Duck Duck Go as my default search engine slowed me down, because a Google search also showed a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/A+J+Moore+Jr+%26+Sr+High+School,+S+University+Parks+Dr+%26,+Clay+Ave,+Waco,+TX+76706/@31.5561661,-97.1224572,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x864f836cce0c14ff:0xe57965c9cf95f65e!8m2!3d31.5559935!4d-97.123192!16s%2Fg%2F11pwjxmn0x">useful map</a> more quickly. Coincidentally enough, the modern A. J. Moore Academy was at 500 <em>North</em> University Parks Dr, while the Moore High School site is very close to 500 <em>South</em> University Parks, adding to some initial confusion.</p>
<p>Finally, I did find the marker I was looking for, though I had to walk past some ‚Äúroad closed‚Äù signs to get there. The site of the school that educated thousands of Black Texans from the earliest days of emancipation through the era of segregation is now ground zero for a major riverfront development project. Because of the construction, I was only able to see the site of Gloria Darlene Oliver‚Äôs alma mater from a distance; I marked the point with a red arrow in this photograph I took. It was a meaningful moment, nonetheless.</p>
