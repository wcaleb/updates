			 <p>I’m hoping to mark every day of Black History Month by making some improvement to a related entry on Wikipedia, something small but constructive. Today’s entry: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_McDew">Charles McDew</a>, a co-founder and the second chairman of SNCC.</p>

			 <p>My woodworking dad surprised me by making this unnerving likeness of <a href="https://wallaceandgromit.fandom.com/wiki/Feathers_McGraw">Feathers McGraw</a> for my office. I initially placed him where my back would be turned to him, but decided <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/wallace-and-gromit-the-story-behind-feather-mcgraws-return.html">that would be a bad idea</a>.</p>

			 <p>Today I spent longer than I care to admit trying to locate precisely the &ldquo;parade ground&rdquo; in Augusta, Georgia, where local African Americans and USCT troops staged <a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/102898175">a celebration of the Fourth of July</a> in 1865.</p>
<p>I finally found it on <a href="https://www.augustamuseum.org/Collections/item3232">this 1872 bird&rsquo;s eye map</a>, next to what is now known as <a href="https://www.augustaga.gov/352/Magnolia">Magnolia Cemetery</a> on the present-day site of <a href="https://www.augustaga.gov/facilities/facility/details/May-Park-92">May Park</a>.</p>
<p>The parade ground was developed by the Augusta city council as a city park on the eve of the Civil War, and you can track that development in the local newspaper at the time. But what threw me off for a long time was the presence of a federal arsenal outside of Augusta (on the other side of town). <a href="https://dp.la/item/ef6a67d27bf65bea8c63f6bebd18d8c1">It also had a parade ground.</a> Just not the parade ground I was looking for.</p>

			 <p>Reading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/thomas-gaither-dead.html">the obituary of Thomas Gaither</a> prompted me to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orangeburg_Massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1272006585">some editing on Wikipedia</a>. I added his co-leadership of a March 1960 student civil rights march in Orangeburg, SC, to the background section on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangeburg_Massacre">the 1968 Orangeburg Massacre</a>.</p>
