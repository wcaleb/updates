			 <p>Reading <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/24/us/thomas-gaither-dead.html">the obituary of Thomas Gaither</a> prompted me to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Orangeburg_Massacre&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1272006585">some editing on Wikipedia</a>. I added his co-leadership of a March 1960 student civil rights march in Orangeburg, SC, to the background section on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orangeburg_Massacre">the 1968 Orangeburg Massacre</a>.</p>

			 <p>Today <a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL45717938M/Why_the_Civil_War">this volume</a> was sitting on the &ldquo;free books&rdquo; cart at the library and I couldn&rsquo;t help but take a peek.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Eisenschiml">Otto Eisenschiml</a> was an Austrian-American chemist and hobbyist Civil War historian most famous (or infamous) for his book promulgating the wild and false conspiracy theory that Lincoln&rsquo;s assassination was ordered by his Secretary of War. Yet his 1958 follow-up <em>Why the Civil War?</em> (one of his many other books) was apparently deemed worthy of a review in the <a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/07/20/91399568.html?pageNumber=79">New York Times</a> by David Herbert Donald.</p>
<p>Eisenschiml, Donald warned readers, was not &ldquo;bothered by his failure to produce evidence to support his assertions.&rdquo; Moreover, &ldquo;The fact that these opinions may contradict those of every Lincoln expert in the country does not at all disturb Mr. Eisenschiml.&rdquo; On the contrary, that seemed a selling-point for the publisher and the author. On the back of the book, above a blurb by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Schenck_Miers">Earl Schenck Miers</a>, is this prescient pitch: &ldquo;<em>Why the Civil War?</em> Will Make Blood Boil, Says Historian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the subtitle on the front, there&rsquo;s not much in the way of &ldquo;a new view,&rdquo; just warmed over &ldquo;needless war&rdquo; revisionism long refuted decisively by scholars of the period. Indeed, it might help me illustrate the problems with that discredited school to my students, with whom I am slated to discuss the subject next week in my course. But I did learn something new while falling down this rabbit hole: Eisenschiml co-wrote another book with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Newman">Ralph G. Newman</a>, legendary bookseller and founder of <a href="https://www.chicagocwrt.org/history.html">the charter Civil War Roundtable in Chicago</a>. And according to Wikipedia, Newman&rsquo;s step-son was none other than &hellip; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Simon">Scott Simon</a> of NPR Weekend Edition fame.</p>
<p>Thanks for that, free library cart. I knew I needed another book.</p>
