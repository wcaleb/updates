		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This morning I attended an excellent panel, <a href="https://events.rice.edu/event/360499-juneteenth-and-justice-for-all-black-struggle-the">Juneteenth and Justice for All: Black Struggle, the Constitution, and Democratic Futures</a>, on campus at Rice. From it I learned (among many things) that <a href="https://www.pennpress.org/9781512825800/she-changed-the-nation/">Mary Ellen Curtin&rsquo;s forthcoming biography</a> of native Houstonian <a href="https://kinder.rice.edu/urbanedge/houston-honors-barbara-jordan">Barbara Jordan</a> is now available for preorder.</p>
<p>As we listened to a recorded snippet from <a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/impeachment/my-faith-constitution-whole-it-complete-it-total">Representative Jordan&rsquo;s famous 1974 impeachment speech</a>, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think about the circumstances surrounding what was likely her first time speaking on the Rice campus. In 1963, while the university was still segregated and just beginning a lawsuit to revise its founding charter, Jordan was invited by the Young Democrats to speak at one of the university&rsquo;s residential colleges. <a href="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth244899/m1/5/?q=%22barbara%20jordan%22">But her appearance was reported in the student newspaper only after it had occurred.</a></p>
<p>Many years later, in an untitled 1989 speech now available only in <a href="https://archives.library.rice.edu/repositories/2/resources/1347/collection_organization#tree::archival_object_333180">his archival papers</a>, English professor Alan Grob claimed that &ldquo;the first black speaker at Rice&rdquo; was &ldquo;a very young woman who had recently graduated from Texas Southern and Boston University Law School, Barbara Jordan, who was apparently surreptitiously brought to Jones College to speak in behalf of desegregation (which she did extremely well) and the right of people like herself to be considered for admission to Rice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grob was wrong about Jordan&rsquo;s being the first Black speaker on campus. He was not wrong&mdash;I am sure of this&mdash;to remember her speech as a powerful one. And it was not her last appearance at Rice. When she returned to campus two years later, <a href="https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth244952/m1/1/">Jordan&rsquo;s photograph was featured on the student newspaper&rsquo;s front page</a>, opposite a report on Rice&rsquo;s ongoing litigation about changing its charter. Her subject: redistricting in Texas to provide more equitable representation to cities and end rural domination in the state. &ldquo;For the first time in Texas,&rdquo; she said on that occasion, &ldquo;we are going to have legislators who represent people, not cattle.&rdquo; It was the kind of richly layered comment that typified Jordan&rsquo;s speeches. I&rsquo;m looking forward to reading Curtin&rsquo;s new biography.</p>

			 <p>I maintain an <a href="http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu">open research notebook</a> that runs on <a href="https://github.com/jgm/gitit/blob/master/README.markdown">Gitit</a>, which means that updates to the wiki are basically commits to a git repository. Nine years ago, a few years after starting the notebook, I wrote a <a href="https://gist.github.com/wcaleb/60d52759f6d0c5bc270d">Python script</a> that would check for changes to the wiki&rsquo;s git repo and post updates to Twitter, like <a href="http://wcaleb.org/twitter/619614774326759426/">this</a> or <a href="http://wcaleb.org/twitter/619614774326759426/">this</a>. Now I&rsquo;ve replaced that with a <a href="https://gist.github.com/wcaleb/67d7554ce2be625a090f8a72a6cd92d6">bash script</a> that posts updates to this site using <code>curl</code> and <a href="https://book.micro.blog/micropub/">Micropub</a>, like <a href="https://updates.wcaleb.org/2024/06/12/updated-some-notes.html">this</a> or <a href="https://updates.wcaleb.org/2024/06/08/updated-some-notes.html">this</a>.

			 <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000902170648/http://www.tamu.edu/chr/agora/">This might be the earliest (extant) website I ever made.</a> It was for a now long-defunct online undergraduate humanities journal that I started while in college, around the time I was just learning about how to write HTML.</p>
<p><em>Agora</em> didn&rsquo;t last long, but it has the distinction (I think) of being the first to publish the scholarly work of my fellow Texan historian and digital humanist <a href="https://www.andrewtorget.com">Andrew Torget</a>. Only after we were out of graduate school, many years later, did Andrew and I put together that our paths had crossed as undergrads in the hypertext pages of <em>Agora,</em> where I helped to edit <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040615140143/http://www.tamu.edu/chr/agora/winter00/torget.pdf">his article on the work of the Freedmen&rsquo;s Bureau in Texas</a> for the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20011115093434/http://www.tamu.edu/chr/agora/archives.html">Winter 2000 issue</a>, both of which are still preserved in the Internet Archive. Amazingly, despite being history majors on campus at the same time, we never had a class together or met in person as undergraduates.</p>
<p>Many years after we realized and remembered <em>that</em> connection, Andrew invited me to speak about <a href="http://wcaleb.org/books/sweet-taste-of-liberty"><em>Sweet Taste of Liberty</em></a> at UNT. And it was then that we realized a further small-world connection: <a href="http://wiki.wcaleb.rice.edu/Robertson%20County">Robertson County</a>, the focus of his long-ago paper, was also the county where Henrietta Wood and other enslaved people were forced to work by Mississippi planter Gerard Brandon during and immediately after the Civil War. In following Wood&rsquo;s story to Texas, I had ended up looking, unawares, at some of the same agents and Bureau sources Andrew had mined decades before, though on FamilySearch instead of on the microfilm reels I think he probably used.</p>
<p>I guess the <a href="http://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> is aptly named, because finding that <em>Agora</em> snapshot takes me <em>way</em> back.</p>

			 <p>After a day at Houston’s Municipal Court for jury service (without being selected), I picked up this gem of a rare book at nearby <a href="https://kaboombooks.com/">Kaboom Books</a>.</p>
<p>Published in 1942, it’s the <a href="https://archive.org/details/houstonahistory00writmiss/mode/1up">Houston installment</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Guide_Series">American Guide Series</a> of books produced by the Federal Writers’ Project during the New Deal. The subtitle (which is different from the one on the title page) is a bit overconfident, I’d say, but it’s still a valuable resource.</p>
<p>It’s rare to see a copy with the dust jacket, which may be intended to portray the Battle of San Jacinto; a map of the battlefield is on the inside cover. Even rarer, though, to find inside a bookmark from Colleen’s Books, a former Houston rare books store that I never knew about until today. <a href="http://southbelthouston.blogspot.com/2017/11/colleens-books-6880-telephone-rd-houston.html?m=1">There’s a nice remembrance of the place online.</a>.</p>

			 <p>Like so many others over this last week, I am mourning the loss of a beloved teacher and mentor: American intellectual historian <a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2024/05/29/dorothy-ross-obituary/">Dorothy Ross</a>. Together with Ronald G. Walters, Dorothy was one of my doctoral co-advisors at Johns Hopkins University and had a profound impact on my life and career.</p>
<p>Dorothy challenged her students. In the first week of my first semester of her seminar, we were assigned to read all of Perry Miller&rsquo;s <em>New England Mind,</em> a book of some 500 pages, and summarize it in a précis of four pages or less. The next assignment was to do the same with <em>The Machiavellian Moment</em> by John Pocock!</p>
<p>Yet within and behind such challenges was a deeper message. From Day One, Dorothy treated her students as colleagues and respected peers, a status we certainly had not earned but that she believed, against the evidence, that we could grow into. There was, as Miller might have put it, a covenant established between teacher and student, one defined always by Dorothy&rsquo;s incomparable intellect and grace.</p>
<p>I last saw her in person a few years ago when this picture was taken at a breakfast we shared in Washington, D.C. I will miss her warmth and wise counsel very much.</p>

			 <p>A number of pages on the Internet, including on sites hosted by the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/blacks-civil-war">National Archives</a> and the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/chyo/learn/historyculture/african-americans-in-the-civil-war.htm">National Park Service</a>, attribute these words to the great abolitionist Frederick Douglass:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letter, U.S., let him get an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoulder and bullets in his pocket, there is no power on earth that can deny that he has earned the right to citizenship.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That bugged me, first, because the quotation contains a grammatical error. &ldquo;U&rdquo; and &ldquo;S&rdquo; are <em>letters</em> plural, not &ldquo;letter&rdquo; singular. There also seems to be an &ldquo;and&rdquo; missing after the final comma.</p>
<p>Were those errors really Douglass&rsquo;s, I wondered? I tracked down the source of the quotation in the scholarly, multivolume work, <em>The Frederick Douglass Papers,</em> edited by John W. Blassingame and published by Yale University Press. Series One, Volume 3, page 596, contains the full quote this way, from a speech delivered in Philadelphia on July 6, 1863:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once let the black man get upon his person the brass letters U.S.; let him get an eagle on his button, and a musket on his shoulder, and bullets in his pocket, and there is no power on the earth or under the earth which can deny that he has earned the right of citizenship in the United States.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems to settle that Douglass did say &ldquo;letters&rdquo; and &ldquo;and.&rdquo; And it also reveals another phrase which even many sources that get most of the quote right, like the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/classroom-materials/united-states-history-primary-source-timeline/civil-war-and-reconstruction-1861-1877/african-american-soldiers-during-the-civil-war/">Library of Congress</a>, sometimes leave out: his reference to there being no power &ldquo;under the earth&rdquo; capable of denying a Black soldier&rsquo;s citizenship.</p>
<p>One can almost imagine Douglass, one of history&rsquo;s great orators, pausing and looking down towards hell as he uttered that sardonic phrase. If he did, the rhetorical flourish would better explain why, according to the transcript in the <em>Frederick Douglass Papers,</em> the sentence was followed not only by applause from the audience, but by laughter.</p>

			 <p>As a historian and a dad, I often gently compel family members to traipse around the country looking for or at the historic sites I study. (Sorry, not sorry, kids!) On a recent trip through Waco, I wanted to visit the historic site of A. J. Moore High School, but that proved more difficult than I expected.</p>
<p>With roots stretching back to Reconstruction, <a href="https://wacohistory.org/items/show/22">A. J. Moore High School</a> was a storied and vital institution for Waco’s African American community until its closure in 1971. An active <a href="https://ajmoorealumni.org/about/">alumni community</a> keeps its legacy alive.</p>
<p>I was interested in visiting the school site because the <a href="https://taskforce.rice.edu/final-report">final report</a> of Rice University’s Task Force on Slavery, Segregation, and Racial Injustice, which I co-chaired, opens with a scene from the school’s 1967 commencement ceremony. That year’s Moore valedictorian, Gloria Darlene Oliver, became perhaps the fifth Black undergraduate student ever to enroll at Rice, which had just begun to desegregate a few years before.</p>
<p>I knew there was a historical marker for Moore High, but the excellent article at <a href="https://wacohistory.org/items/show/22">Waco History</a> gave the school’s address on First Street, which no longer shows up on maps. Other pages I found, like <a href="https://texashistoricalmarkers.weebly.com/a-j-moore-high-school.html">this one</a>, apparently confuse the marker’s location with the location of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.J._Moore_Academy">A. J. Moore Academy</a> (also now closed). Recent articles about Moore history from Waco’s local newspaper were behind a paywall, which is no help when the family is waiting semi-patiently on Dad to track down a marker.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the location for the marker given by the <a href="https://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/Details/5309000053">Texas Historical Commission</a> is the correct one, and eventually I landed there. This may be a case where my preference for Duck Duck Go as my default search engine slowed me down, because a Google search also showed a <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/A+J+Moore+Jr+%26+Sr+High+School,+S+University+Parks+Dr+%26,+Clay+Ave,+Waco,+TX+76706/@31.5561661,-97.1224572,16z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x864f836cce0c14ff:0xe57965c9cf95f65e!8m2!3d31.5559935!4d-97.123192!16s%2Fg%2F11pwjxmn0x">useful map</a> more quickly. Coincidentally enough, the modern A. J. Moore Academy was at 500 <em>North</em> University Parks Dr, while the Moore High School site is very close to 500 <em>South</em> University Parks, adding to some initial confusion.</p>
<p>Finally, I did find the marker I was looking for, though I had to walk past some “road closed” signs to get there. The site of the school that educated thousands of Black Texans from the earliest days of emancipation through the era of segregation is now ground zero for a major riverfront development project. Because of the construction, I was only able to see the site of Gloria Darlene Oliver’s alma mater from a distance; I marked the point with a red arrow in this photograph I took. It was a meaningful moment, nonetheless.</p>
