There also seems to be an &ldquo;and&rdquo; missing after the final comma.</p>\n<p>Were those errors really Douglass&rsquo;s, I wondered? I tracked down the source of the quotation in the scholarly, multivolume work, <em>The Frederick Douglass Papers,</em> edited by John W. Blassingame and published by Yale University Press.

If he did, the rhetorical flourish would better explain why, according to the transcript in the <em>Frederick Douglass Papers,</em> the sentence was followed not only by applause from the audience, but by laughter.</p>\n",
